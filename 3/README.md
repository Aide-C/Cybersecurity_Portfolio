# Apply Filters to SQL Queries
In this activity, I created a new report document to demonstrate my experience using SQL.

**The scenario:**
I am a security professional at a large organization. Part of my job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure.
I recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines.
My task was to examine the organizationâ€™s data in their employees and log_in_attempts tables. I needed to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.

**Note:** This scenario involves the same queries as the ones the course's  Filter with AND, OR, and NOT Qwuiklab. I revisited the lab to get screenshots to include in my report document.
