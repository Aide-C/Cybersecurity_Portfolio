# Analyze a Vulnerable System for a Small Business

In this activity, I conducted a vulnerability assessment for a small business. A vulnerability assessment is the internal review process of an organizationâ€™s security systems.
I evaluated the risks of a vulnerable information system and outlined a remediation plan. As a cybersecurity analyst, I will help with vulnerability assessments to prevent attacks in an organization.

The scenario:
I am a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. 
Employees of the company regularly query or request data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. 
As a cybersecurity professional, I recognized that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability. I was tasked with completing a vulnerability assessment of the situation to communicate the potential risks to decision makers at the company.
I created a written report that explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.
