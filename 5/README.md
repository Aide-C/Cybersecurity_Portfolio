# Finalize my Incident Handler’s Journal
In this activity, I finalized the incident handler's journal that I've been working on throughout this course. 
As I progressed through this course, I used my incident handler’s journal to apply my documentation skills and keep track of my learning journey. By now, I have multiple entries in my journal.

Scenario #1:
A small U.S. health care clinic specializing in delivering primary-care services experienced a security incident on a Tuesday morning, at approximately 9:00 a.m. Several employees reported that they were unable to use their computers to access files like medical records. Business operations shut down because employees were unable to access the files and software needed to do their job.
Additionally, employees also reported that a ransom note was displayed on their computers. The ransom note stated that all the company's files were encrypted by an organized group of unethical hackers who are known to target organizations in healthcare and transportation industries. In exchange for restoring access to the encrypted files, the ransom note demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key.
The attackers were able to gain access into the company's network by using targeted phishing emails, which were sent to several employees of the company. The phishing emails contained a malicious attachment that installed malware on the employee's computer once it was downloaded.
Once the attackers gained access, they deployed their ransomware, which encrypted critical files. The company was unable to access critical patient data, causing major disruptions in their business operations. The company was forced to shut down their computer systems and contact several organizations to report the incident and receive technical assistance.

Scenario #4: 
I recently joined the security team as a level-one security operation center (SOC) analyst at a mid-sized retail company. Along with its physical store locations, my company also conducts operations in e-commerce, which account for 80% of its sales.

I spent my first week of training becoming familiar with the company's security processes and procedures. Recently, the company experienced a major security incident involving a data breach of over one million users. Because this was a recent and major security incident, my team is working to prevent incidents like this from happening again. This breach happened before I began working at the company. I was asked to review the final report.
To gain an understanding of the incident's life cycle, my goals for the review are as follows:

Goal 1: Identify exactly what happened.

Goal 2: Identify when it happened. 

Goal 3: Identify the response actions that the company took.

Goal 4: Identify future recommendations

Scenario #5:
I am a security analyst working at the e-commerce store Buttercup Games. I was tasked with identifying whether there are any possible security issues with the mail server. To do so, I explored any failed SSH logins for the root account on Splunk. 

Scenario #6:
I am a security analyst at a financial services company. I received an alert that an employee received a phishing email in their inbox. I reviewed the alert and identify a suspicious domain name contained in the email's body: signin.office365x24.com. I needed to determine whether any other employees have received phishing emails containing this domain and whether they have visited the domain. I used Chronicle to investigate this domain.
