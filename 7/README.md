# Update a file through a Python algorithm
In this activity, I created a new report document to demonstrate my experience using Python to develop algorithms that involve opening files and parsing their contents.

The scenario:
I am a security professional working at a health care company. As part of my job, I'm required to regularly update a file that identifies the employees who can access restricted content. The contents of the file are based on who is working with personal patient records. Employees are restricted access based on their IP address. There is an allow list for IP addresses permitted to sign into the restricted subnetwork. There's also a remove list that identifies which employees I must remove from this allow list.
My task was to create an algorithm that uses Python code to check whether the allow list contains any IP addresses identified on the remove list. If so, I removed those IP addresses from the file containing the allow list.

Note: This scenario involves developing the same algorithm that is developed in Tasks 2-7 of the 
Create another algorithm Qwuiklab. I revisited the lab to get screenshots to include in my report document.
